# Can you write a program to swap values of two variables
# So what is swapping? 
# Swapping means interchanging the values in those variables. 

x=10
y=15 
z=y
y=x
x=z
print(y,x)
print("*** Task 1:***")
# Now let us swap the values.
# Uncomment the statements below and run to see how it executes:
# NAME = input("Enter your first name: ")  
# Surname = input("Enter your last name: ")
# print("Hello " + NAME + " " + Surname)

# Now to swap let us make use of another variable called temp
# temp = NAME
# NAME = Surname
# Surname = temp
# print("Hello " + NAME + " " + Surname)


# Initial state: a = 5 and b=7
# Final state:  a=7 and b=5
a=5
b=10
x=b
b=a
a=x
print(a,b)




'''Awesome! This is a concept used in many complex programs such as Sorting. We will be learning this very soon.'''
