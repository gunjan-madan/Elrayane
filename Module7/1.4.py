# Mr. Turtle has written a piece of code which he wants you to execute and observe the output displayed

# Uncomment the statements below and click Run
# import turtle
# turtle.clearscreen()
# turtle.shape("turtle")
# turtle.pensize(4)
# turtle.left(90)
# turtle.circle(50,180)

# What is displayed on the output terminal?
# In the command turtle.circle(50,180), 50 is the radius and 180 is the  angle, to draw a semi-circle
# Mr. Turtle wants you to draw a rainbow, where:

# A semi-circle of the chosen colour is drawn
# Mr.Turtle uses the if statements to get the colour choice from the user.
# And allows the user to select multiple times until the user exits. 
# He wants you to write the code to create the semi-circle. 
# Uncomment the statement below, complete the code for the semi-circle and then click Run.
